### _**Practical Exercise 2**_

#### Enabling code scanning

1. Go to the `Code scanning alerts` section in the `Security` tab.

2. Start the `Set up this workflow` step in the `CodeQL Analysis` card.

3. Review the created Action workflow and accept the default proposed workflow.

4. Head over to the `Actions` tab to see the created workflow in action.

#### Reviewing any failed analysis job

CodeQL requires a build of compiled languages, and an analysis job can fail if our *autobuilder* is unable to build a program to extract an analysis database.

1. Head over to the Java job and determine if there's a build failure.

2. Our project targets JDK version 11. How can we check the java version that the GitHub hosted runner is using?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

    - run: |
        echo "java version"
        java -version

</details>

#### Using context and expressions to modify build

How would you [modify](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions) the build such that the autobuild step runs only for Java?

  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  You can run this step for only `Java` analysis when you use the `if` expression and `matrix` context.

  ```yaml
  - if: matrix.language == 'java'  
    uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v1
  ```
  </details>
  
#### Reviewing and managing results

1. Go to the `Code scanning results` in the `Security` tab.

2. For a result, determine:
    1. The issue reported.
    1. The corresponding query id.
    1. Its `Common Weakness Enumeration` identifier.
    1. The recommendation to solve the issue.
    1. The path from the `source` to the `sink`. Where would you apply a fix?
    1. Is it a *true positive* or *false positive*?

#### Triaging a result in a PR

The default workflow configuration enables code scanning on PRs.
Follow the next steps to see it in action.

1. Add a vulnerable snippet of code and commit it to a patch branch and create a PR.

    Make the following change in `frontend/src/components/AuthorizationCallback.vue:27`

    ```javascript
     - if (this.hasCode && this.hasState) {
     + eval(this.code)    
     + if (this.hasCode && this.hasState) {
    ```
2. Is the vulnerability detected in your PR?

#### _Stretch Exercise 1: Fixing false positive results_

If you have identified a false positive, how would you deal with that? What if this is a common pattern within your applications?

#### _Stretch Exercise 2: Enabling code scanning on your own repository_

So far you've learned how to enable secret scanning, Dependabot and code scanning. Try enabling this on your own repository, and see what kind of results you get!

### _**Practical Exercise 3**_

#### Customizing CodeQL Configuration

By default, CodeQL uses a selection of queries that provide high quality security results.
However, you might want to change this behavior to:

- Include code-quality queries.
- Include queries with a lower signal to noise ratio to detect more potential issues.
- To exclude queries in the default pack because they generate *false positives* for your architecture.
- Include custom queries written for your project.

1.  Create the file `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` and enable the `security-and-quality` suite.

    **Hints**

    1. A configuration file contains a key `queries` where you can specify additional queries as follows

        ```yaml
        name: "My CodeQL config"

        queries:
            - uses: <insert your query suite>
        ```
2. Enable your custom configuration in the code scanning workflow file `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`

    **Hints**

    1. The `init` action supports a `config-file` parameter to specify a configuration file.

3. After the code scanning action has completed, are there new code scanning results?

#### Adding your own code scanning suite to exclude rules

The queries that are executed is determined by the code scanning suite for a target language.
You can create your own code scanning suite to change the set of included queries.

By creating our own [code scanning suite](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/creating-codeql-query-suites/), we can exclude the rule that caused the false positive in our Java project.

1. Create the file `custom-queries/code-scanning.qls` with the contents

    ```yaml
    # Reusing existing QL Pack
    - import: codeql-suites/javascript-code-scanning.qls
      from: codeql-javascript
    - import: codeql-suites/java-code-scanning.qls
      from: codeql-java
    - import: codeql-suites/python-code-scanning.qls
      from: codeql-python
    - import: codeql-suites/go-code-scanning.qls
      from: codeql-go
    - exclude:
      id:
        - <insert rule id of false positive>
    ```

2. Configure the file `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` to use our suite

    **Hint** We are now running both the default code scanning suite and our own custom suite.
    To prevent double results disable the default queries with the option `disable-default-queries: true`

3. After the code scanning action has completed, is the false positive still there?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```yaml
# Reusing existing QL Pack
- import: codeql-suites/javascript-code-scanning.qls
  from: codeql-javascript
- import: codeql-suites/java-code-scanning.qls
  from: codeql-java
- import: codeql-suites/python-code-scanning.qls
  from: codeql-python
- import: codeql-suites/go-code-scanning.qls
  from: codeql-go
- exclude:
  id:
    - java/spring-disabled-csrf-protection
```
</details>

4. Try running additional queries with `security-extended` or `security-and-quality`. What kind of results do you see?

5. Try specifying directories to scan or not to scan. Why would you include this in the configuration?

#### Understanding how to add a custom query

One of the strong suites of CodeQL is its high-level language QL that can be used to write your own queries.
_If you have experience with CodeQL and have come up with your own query so far, take this time to commit those changes and see if any alerts were produced._
Regardless of experience, the next steps show you how to add one.

1. Make sure to create a QL pack file. For example, `custom-queries/go/qlpack.yml` with the contents

    ```yaml
    name: My Go queries
    version: 0.0.0
    libraryPathDependencies:
        - codeql-go
    ```

    This file creates a [QL query pack](https://help.semmle.com/codeql/codeql-cli/reference/qlpack-overview.html) used to organize query files and their dependencies.

2. Then, create the actual query file. For example, `custom-queries/go/jwt.ql` with the contents

    ```ql
    /**
    * @name Missing token verification
    * @description Missing token verification
    * @id go/user-controlled-bypass
    * @kind problem
    * @problem.severity warning
    * @precision high
    * @tags security
    */
    import go
    /*
    * Identify processors that are missing the token verification:
    *
    * func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
    *    // Don't forget to validate the alg is what you expect:
    *    //if _, ok := token.Method.(*jwt.SigningMethodHMAC); !ok {
    *    //        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Unexpected signing method: %v", token.Header["alg"])
    *    //}
    *    ...
    * }
    */
    from FuncLit f
    where
        // Identify the function via the argument part of the its signature
        //     func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) { ... }
        f.getParameter(0).getType() instanceof PointerType and
        f.getParameter(0).getType().(PointerType).getBaseType().getName() = "Token" and
        f.getParameter(0).getType().(PointerType).getBaseType().getPackage().getName() = "jwt" and
        // and check whether it uses jwt.SigningMethodHMAC in any way
        not exists(TypeExpr t |
            f.getBody().getAChild*() = t and
            t.getType().getName() = "SigningMethodHMAC" and
            t.getType().getPackage().getName() = "jwt"
        )
    select f, "This function should be using jwt.SigningMethodHMAC"
    ```
3. Then, add the query to the CodeQL configuration file `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`

**Hint** The `uses` key accepts repository relative paths.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```yaml
name: "My CodeQL config"

disable-default-queries: true

queries:
    - uses: security-and-quality
    - uses: ./custom-queries/code-scanning.qls
    - uses: ./custom-queries/go/jwt.ql

```
</details>

#### _Stretch Exercise 3: Adding a custom query from an external repository_

How would you incorporate that query/queries from other repositories?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```yaml
name: "CodeQL Config"

disable-default-queries: false

queries:
  - name: go-custom-queries
    uses: {owner}/{repository}/<path-to-query>@<some-branch>
  - uses: security-and-quality
```
</details>
